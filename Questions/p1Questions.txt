1. I estimate that this assignment will take me at least 4.25 hours
    to complete given time to review lecture videos and research
    functions in addition to the actual programming and debugging.
2. Thought/Design: I am including research into java functions, ant 
    build files, and web server information into this section, 
    which overall took me about 6.5 hours.
   Programming: The actual programming of the assignment took me 
    about 1.75 hours including documentation.
   Debugging: The debugging process included fixing 404 HTML body 
    response and ant file path stuff in addition to small syntax 
    errors. This took me approximately 1.25 hours.
   Total: The total time spent on this assignment came out to 
    about 8.5 hours.
3. My time spent on this assignment was double what I expected,
    which yields a percent error of ((8.5-4.25)/4.25) = 100%.
    I would like to note that as an EE major with little knowledge 
    of web servers and little experience in java, I seriously 
    underestimated how long it would take me to complete this 
    assignment.
